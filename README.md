# Eater Game Projects

This workspace contains two main game projects:


## 1. Emoji Eater Game
- **Location:** `Emoj/`
- **Description:**
  - A fun, interactive snake-style game where the snake is made of emojis. The head is a 👾 emoji, and the body is made of 👁‍🗨 emojis. Bets (collectibles) are randomly placed Food & Drink emojis. The player moves the snake to collect these emojis, growing the snake and increasing the score.
  - The game uses PixiJS for rendering and supports both mouse and touch controls.
  - The visual style is playful and colorful, making use of modern emoji graphics.
